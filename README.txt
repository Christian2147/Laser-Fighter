Created In: PyCharm IDE Community Edition for Python v3.7.3
This is Minor Update 1.2.0b

This game is a big project that I am working on mainly for fun. I enjoyed every bit of making this game so far and I hope you enjoy every bit of playing it!
So far, this project has taken me roughly 600 hours to create.
If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add next, email me on the following email: christianm7765@gmail.com
You can also report any bugs via this email or on the Laser Fighter GitHub issues page.

Instructions:
If you want to make a shortcut on your desktop, I have provided an appropriate icon file in the Icon folder for a shortcut if the icon on the exe happens to break. 
To make a shortcut and change the icon:
1. Right-click on Laser_Fighter.exe and select "create shortcut"
2. Go to the shortcut and right click it and hit "properties"
3. Go to "shortcut" and hit "Change Icon"
4. Click "browse"
5. Find the icon provided and accept all changes
There are no other instructions other than to try to get the highest score possible

NOTE: The exe file for this application is unsigned and has an unverified publisher. This means that Windows Defender and other antivirus software may be suspicious of the file. 
If this happens, simply select "Run Anyway". Make sure you are downloading Laser Fighter from https://github.com/Christian2147/Laser-Fighter and no other external source. 
If you download Laser Fighter from any other source, I am not responsible for any damage that the executable may cause. 
Outside of this GitHub page, anyone is allowed to make whatever modifications they want to this software.

Goals for you:
For Machine Mode, beat the pink boss at least once.

This game is a big project that I am working on mainly for fun. I enjoyed every bit of making this game so far and I hope you enjoy every bit of playing it!
So far, this project has taken me roughly 200 hours to create.
If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add next, email me on the following email: christianm7765@gmail.com

Note: This game has a fixed screen of 1280 x 720 which cannot be modified in any way

Instructions:
If you want to make a shortcut on your desktop, I have provided an appropiate icon file in the Icon folder for a shortcut if the icon on the exe happens to break. 
To mack a shortcut and change the icon:
1. Right click on Laser_Fighter.exe and hit "create shortcut"
2. Go to the shortcut and right click it and hit "properties"
3. Go to "shortcut" and hit "Change Icon"
4. Hit "browse"
5. Find the icon provided and accept all changes
There are no other instructions other than to try to get the highest score possible

Goals:
For classic mode I would say try to beat the pink boss at least once
For alien mode I would say try and kill the UFO at least once
Good luck both modes are very difficult!

Changelog:
+ Added a statistics screen, where you can see a list of your in-game stats
* Fixed the flickering text bug
* Fixed a bug that sometimes caused buttons to not register a click from the mouse
* Fixed a bug that caused the text of certain buttons to turn yellow while changing modes even if not hovering over them
* Changed the window icon to the offical Laser Fighter icon
* Changed the color of all buttons to be darker so that the text is easier to read

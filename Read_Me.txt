This game is a big project that I am working on mainly for fun. I enjoyed every bit of making this game so far and I hope you enjoy every bit of playing it!
So far, this project has taken me roughly 250 hours to create.
If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add next, email me on the following email: christianm7765@gmail.com

Note: This game has a fixed screen of 1280 x 720 which cannot be modified in any way

Instructions:
If you want to make a shortcut on your desktop, I have provided an appropiate icon file in the Icon folder for a shortcut if the icon on the exe happens to break. 
To mack a shortcut and change the icon:
1. Right click on Laser_Fighter.exe and hit "create shortcut"
2. Go to the shortcut and right click it and hit "properties"
3. Go to "shortcut" and hit "Change Icon"
4. Hit "browse"
5. Find the icon provided and accept all changes
There are no other instructions other than to try to get the highest score possible

Goals:
For classic mode I would say try to beat the pink boss at least once
For alien mode I would say try and kill the UFO at least once
Good luck both modes are very difficult!

Changelog:
+ Added power ups! Power ups will randomly spawn while you are playing either Machine Mode or Alien Mode and will make the gameplay more unique
+ Added new sounds and statistics that come with the power ups
+ Added a controls screen for controls
* Fixed some major preformence issues
* Fixed a bug that caused the alien space ship to not move properly when killed enough times
* Changed the layout of the settings screen
* Renamed Classic Mode to Machine Mode

Power Ups And What They Do:
Red Power Up - Found only in Alien Mode, it allows the players laser to pierce through an infinite amount of enemies instead of just two for 15 seconds
Yellow Power Up - Increases the speed that the players laser moves and how frquently it can be fired in both Machine Mode and Alien Mode for 20 seconds
Green Power Up - Found only in Machine Mode, it stops all enemy lasers from firing for 15 seconds
Blue Power Up - Doubles every score increase in both Machine Mode and Alien Mode for 45 seconds

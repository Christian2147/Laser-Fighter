This is version 1.0.0

This game was a winter break project that I created mainly for fun. I enjoyed every bit of making this game and I hope you enjoy every bit of playing it!
The game took about a week to create an d roughly 40-50 hours of work has been spent on it.
If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add next, email me on the following email: christianm7765@gmail.com

Controls:
a - move left
d - move right
space - shoot
v - toggle sound on/off

Instructions:
Starting the game: To start the game, run the file titled "Machine_War_I.exe"
There are no other instructions other than to try to get the highest score possible

Goals:
If I were to give you a goal, I would say it would be to try to kill the pink boss that comes out when your score reaches 100(good luck its very hard!)

# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first version was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 600 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is on the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familiar with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start.


## Version 1.0.1b:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v1.0.1b. This version was completed in July of 2024. This updated fixed several bugs that were either introduced or ongoing in version 1.0.0b. This is the games first ever Hotfix update, which is intended to be released quickly and fix game breaking bugs, not adding any new features to gameplay. This game fixed several bugs regarding slow motion and fullscreen, which is a newly added feature in version 1.0.0b.

# Laser-Fighter

This is the main repository for Laser Fighter. (Repository & Game are currently a work in progress, Check back on 7/2/24)

## Version 0.2.0a:

This branch contains the source for Laser Fighter v0.2.0a. This version was completed in August of 2022. This was the biggest update that the game has ever recieved, totalling 5000 lines of code and doezens of new textures. Around this time, my knowledge of the turtle library has advanced considerably, and I was able to make advanced graphical elements with it like buttons and different screens. However, I still had a lot to learn and a lot to figure out. I have learn a lot about file organization, but still needed to figure out how to use classes and how to properly split my code. This version has several bugs, however it is far more stable than the first version. This is the earliest version I recommend that you run From my experience, it runs much smoother and windows will not randomly delete this version from your computer. However, windows defender may still scan it every once in a while.

# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first versions was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 600 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is along the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familier with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start. If you want to know more about the timeline of Laser Fighter, check out its [history](./docs/HISTORY.md).


## Version 1.1.0b:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v1.1.0b. This version was completed in August of 2024. This update is one of the biggest feature updates the game has ever had. In this update, the shop was added. With the shop came player upgrades for Machine Mode, gun upgrades for Alien Mode, and power up upgrades for the whole game. This darastically changed the gameplay and made the game a lot bigger than it already is. This version also fixed several bug and preformance issues, especially for users who were not able to enjoy the preformance improvements from the previous updates.

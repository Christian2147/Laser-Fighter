# Laser-Fighter

This is the main repository for Laser Fighter. (Repository & Game are currently a work in progress, Check back on 7/2/24)

## Version 0.0.1a:

This branch contains the source for Laser Fighter v0.0.1a (Formally named Machine War I at this time). This version was completed back in December of 2021 and it was the first major piece of software that I have created. Back then, I knew little to none about graphics libraries, software development, and proper file organization. I started this project from complete scratch without knowing much of anything other than how to create a simple snake game using turtle graphics, which I learn from a tutorial on YouTube. The ugly mess or this directory, and the ugliness of my code for this version (as well as the usgliness of it running) will come to show how far I have come over the years when it comes to making proper software and how much my knowledge has expanded. 

This version of the game is very primitive, not even containing a title screen. It runs so badly and the code is so messy that windows may automatically delete your executable, thinking that it is malware. If it does so, I would highly recommend not redownloading and just playing a newer version. I am posting this version mainly to show how far I have come.

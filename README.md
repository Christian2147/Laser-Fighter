# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first versions was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 500 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is along the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familiter with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start.

## Version 0.4.0a:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v0.4.0a. This version was completed in August of 2023. Due to having a part time job and getting ready for college, this update was fairly small for a summertime update. This update gave me an introduction into how tick speed and random numbers work, both of which I needed to use to correctly impliment power ups into the game. This is the first update that attempted to fix some of the lag that the game had. However, only basic fixes and procedures were implimented. The code is still messy and all in one file. Around this time, the main focus was on adding extra features that would keep a person playing, and not just have bare minimum gameplay where there is only the score that shows the players progress. 

## Changelog:

# Laser-Fighter

This is the main repository for Laser Fighter. (Repository & Game are currently a work in progress, Check back on 7/2/24)

## Version 0.3.0a:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v0.3.0a. This version was completed in January of 2023. This was a small update that I made over winter break. This version of the game fixed a lot of the bugs that were introduced in version 0.2.0a, and it is more stable than verions 0.0.1a and version 0.2.0a. The code in this version however is still extremely messy and all in one file. Since I only had two weeks to make this update, I focused more on fixing bugs rather than optimizing code. This means that the lag in this version of the game is not much better than the previous version.

## Changelog:

### Additions
+ Added a statistics screen, where you can see a list of your in-game stats

### Changes
* Fixed the flickering text bug
* Fixed a bug that sometimes caused buttons to not register a click from the mouse
* Fixed a bug that caused the text of certain buttons to turn yellow while changing modes even if not hovering over them
* Changed the window icon to the offical Laser Fighter icon
* Changed the color of all buttons to be darker so that the text is easier to read

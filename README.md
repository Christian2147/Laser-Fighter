# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first versions was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 500 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is along the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familiter with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start.

## Version 0.0.1a:

This branch contains the source for Laser Fighter v0.0.1a (Formally named Machine War I at this time). This version was completed back in December of 2021 and it was the first major piece of software that I have created. Back then, I knew little to none about graphics libraries, software development, and proper file organization. I started this project from complete scratch without knowing much of anything other than how to create a simple snake game using turtle graphics, which I learn from a tutorial on YouTube. The ugly mess or this directory, and the ugliness of my code for this version (as well as the usgliness of it running) will come to show how far I have come over the years when it comes to making proper software and how much my knowledge has expanded. 

NOTE: The exe file for this application is unsigned and has an unverified publisher. This means that windows defender and other antiviruses may be suspicious of the file. If this happens, simply select "Run Anyway". Make sure you are downloading Laser Figher from the [Laser Fighter GitHub](https://github.com/Christian2147/Laser-Fighter) and no other external source. If you download Laser Fighter from any other source, I am not responsible for any damage that the executable may cause. Outside of this GitHub page, anyone is allowed to make whatever modifications they want to this software.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: On top of the note above, this version of the game is very primitive, not even containing a title screen. It runs so badly and the code is so messy that windows may automatically delete your executable, regardless of the unverified publisher. This is because the executable has some errors in its script. If it does delete it, I would recommend not redownloading and just playing a newer version. I am posting this version mainly to show how far I have come.

# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first versions was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 500 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is along the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familiter with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start.

## Version 0.3.0a:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v0.3.0a. This version was completed in January of 2023. This was a small update that I made over winter break. This version of the game fixed a lot of the bugs that were introduced in version 0.2.0a, and it is more stable than verions 0.0.1a and version 0.2.0a. The code in this version however is still extremely messy and all in one file. Since I only had two weeks to make this update, I focused more on fixing bugs rather than optimizing code. This means that the lag in this version of the game is not much better than the previous version.

# Laser-Fighter

Laser Fighter is a 2D laser shooting game and is the first game that I have created. The first version was finished in December of 2021 and it has been growing ever since. About 600 hours of work have so far been put into this game and more is on the way. I created this game not only because it was fun but also because I wanted to learn more about the software development process by actually creating a real piece of software. Considering I am really familiar with gaming and indie games, I felt that a 2D pixel shooting game would be a good place to start. If you want to know more about the timeline of Laser Fighter, check out its [history](./docs/HISTORY.md).


## Version 1.2.0b:

This branch contains the source code for Laser Fighter v1.2.0b. This version was completed in August of 2024. This update was small but added several key features to the game and was the first update where the game finally started taking a significant shape. More items were added to the shop, increasing the incentive to actually play the game. A small storyline and progression was also added to the game. This gave the game a plot and the character a reason for being in outer space and killing aliens. Just like the previous versions, this version also fixed several performance issues and bugs, which has always been a top priority.
